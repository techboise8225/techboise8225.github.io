          <h2 class="section-title">Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in early 2025 by a Boise‑based software developer,
            <strong>Boise Tech Connect</strong> started as a side project to
            highlight the vibrant tech ecosystem growing in the Treasure Valley.
            Balancing a full‑time job with a passion for community, our founder
            began publishing bi‑monthly blog posts and a monthly podcast to
            showcase local startups, share learnings and connect like‑minded
            individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that great ideas flourish through collaboration. Boise is
            the <em>13th fastest growing</em> U.S. metro, with an influx of
            talented professionals and entrepreneurs drawn by quality of life and
            opportunity. Yet many remain unaware of the people and projects
            happening right next door. That’s where we come in—telling those
            stories and facilitating connections.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
          <ul class="mission-list">
            <li>Showcase Boise’s innovators and amplify local voices.</li>
            <li>
              Build a welcoming platform that encourages learning and
              collaboration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Organise events that foster meaningful connections and hands‑on
              learning opportunities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="section-title">Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            What began as a hobby is evolving into a full‑time pursuit. Our goal
            is to grow our content cadence, expand our event footprint and
            ultimately hire a small team to elevate Boise Tech Connect into a
            sustainable media and events organisation. We’re actively seeking
            partners and sponsors who share our vision and see the potential in
            Boise’s tech community.
